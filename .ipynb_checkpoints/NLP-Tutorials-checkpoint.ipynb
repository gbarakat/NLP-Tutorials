      "['The early 1990s also saw the discontinuation of the Apple II series, which was expensive to produce, and the company felt was still taking sales away from lower-cost Macintosh models.', 'After the launch of the LC, Apple began encouraging developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorized salespersons to direct consumers towards Macintosh and away from Apple II.', 'The Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993.']\n",

Microsoft Corp.', 'The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed.']\n",

       " <p>Renewed interest in the Magna Carta, the English Civil War, and the Glorious Revolution in the 17th century prompted the growth of <a href=\"/wiki/Political_philosophy\" title=\"Political philosophy\">political philosophy</a> on the British Isles. <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes\" title=\"Thomas Hobbes\">Thomas Hobbes</a> was the first philosopher to articulate a detailed <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Social_contract_theory\" title=\"Social contract theory\">social contract theory</a>. Writing in the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Leviathan_(Hobbes_book)\" title=\"Leviathan (Hobbes book)\">Leviathan</a></i> (1651), Hobbes theorized that individuals living in the <a href=\"/wiki/State_of_nature\" title=\"State of nature\">state of nature</a> led lives that were \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\" and constantly waged a <a href=\"/wiki/Bellum_omnium_contra_omnes\" title=\"Bellum omnium contra omnes\">war of all against all</a>. In order to prevent the occurrence of an anarchic state of nature, Hobbes reasoned that individuals ceded their rights to a strong, authoritarian power. In other words, Hobbes advocated for an absolute monarchy which, in his opinion, was the best form of government. Later, philosopher and physician <a href=\"/wiki/John_Locke\" title=\"John Locke\">John Locke</a> would posit a different interpretation of social contract theory. Writing in his <i><a href=\"/wiki/Two_Treatises_of_Government\" title=\"Two Treatises of Government\">Two Treatises of Government</a></i> (1689), Locke posited that all individuals possessed the inalienable rights to life, liberty and estate (property).<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Locke-Laslett1988_85-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Locke-Laslett1988-85\">[85]</a></sup> According to Locke, individuals would voluntarily come together to form a state for the purposes of defending their rights.
