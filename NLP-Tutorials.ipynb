      "['The early 1990s also saw the discontinuation of the Apple II series, which was expensive to produce, and the company felt was still taking sales away from lower-cost Macintosh models.', 'After the launch of the LC, Apple began encouraging developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorized salespersons to direct consumers towards Macintosh and away from Apple II.', 'The Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993.']\n",

Microsoft Corp.', 'The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed.']\n",
